It states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides.\n","\n","For instance, let's consider a right triangle ABC, with the right angle located at C. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n","\n","BC ** 2 = AB ** 2 + AC ** 2\n","\n","Your code should read in the lengths of the sides AB and AC, and that outputs the length of the hypotenuse (BC). You will probably find math.sqrt() to be useful.\n","\n","Here's a sample run of the program (user input is in bold italics):\n","\n","Enter the length of AB: 3\n","\n","Enter the length of AC: 4\n","\n","The length of BC (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0"],"metadata":{"id":"vYCJ_sx-gd0V"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import math  # Import the math library\n","\n","length_of_AB = float(input(\"Enter the length of AB: \"))\n","length_of_AC = float(input(\"Enter the length of AC: \"))\n","\n","# Calculate the hypotenuse using the two sides and print it out\n","length_of_BC = math.sqrt(length_of_AB ** 2 + length_of_AC ** 2)\n","\n","\n","print(f\"The Length of BC  (the hypotenuse) is: {length_of_BC}\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-IW2ps71giLa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742592303026,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":2927,"user":{"displayName":"Areesha khan","userId":"16032718573199384348"}},"outputId":"475c70ed-f8ae-4d40-f575-234cd2933bf1"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter the length of AB: 3\n","Enter the length of AC: 4\n","The Length of BC  (the hypotenuse) is: 5.0\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
