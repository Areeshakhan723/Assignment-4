If lst is already shorter than MAX_LENGTH you should leave it unchanged. We've written a main() function for you which gets a list and passes it into your function once you run the program. For the autograder to pass you will need MAX_LENGTH to be 3, but feel free to change it around to test your program."],"metadata":{"id":"NY2OP5QR32rg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["MAX_LENGTH: int = 3  # Maximum allowed length of the list\n","\n","def shorten(lst):\n","  \"\"\"Removes extra elements until the list length is MAX_LENGTH.\"\"\"\n","  while len(lst) > MAX_LENGTH: # Keep removing elements if the list is too long\n","    removed_element = lst.pop()   # Remove last element\n","    print(f\"Removed element: {removed_element}\")\n","    print(f\"Shortened list: {lst}\")\n","\n","def get_list():\n","\n","  \"\"\"Collects user input into a list until the user presses Enter.\"\"\"\n","\n","  my_list = [] # create a empty list\n","  print(\"Enter numbers one by one (press Enter to finish): \")\n","\n","  while True:\n","    userInput = input(\"Enter a list of numbers: \").strip()\n","\n","    if userInput == \"\":  # Stop when input is empty\n","      break\n","    my_list.append(userInput)  # Append input to the list\n","\n","  return my_list\n","\n","\n","def main():\n","  lst = get_list() # Get list from user\n","  print(f\"Original list: {lst}\")  # Show original list\n","\n","  shorten(lst) # Shorten list\n","\n","  print(f\"Final list (max {MAX_LENGTH} elements): {lst}\")  # Show final list\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    main()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"h8P6oONf35JW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742833913649,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":11063,"user":{"displayName":"Areesha khan","userId":"16032718573199384348"}},"outputId":"444ca236-2f1a-4d2c-f662-75365cf75936"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter numbers one by one (press Enter to finish): \n","Enter a list of numbers: 1\n","Enter a list of numbers: 2\n","Enter a list of numbers: 3\n","Enter a list of numbers: 4\n","Enter a list of numbers: 5\n","Enter a list of numbers: 6\n","Enter a list of numbers: \n","Original list: ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']\n","Removed element: 6\n","Shortened list: ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']\n","Removed element: 5\n","Shortened list: ['1', '2', '3', '4']\n","Removed element: 4\n","Shortened list: ['1', '2', '3']\n","Final list (max 3 elements): ['1', '2', '3']\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
