We've written a done() function which returns True with likelihood DONE_LIKELIHOOD -- at each number, before printing the number, you should call done() and check if it returns True or not. If done() returns True, we're done counting, and you should use a return statement to end the chaotic_counting() function execution and resume execution of main(), which will print \"I'm done.\". We've written main() for you -- check it out! Notice that we'll only print \"I'm done\" from main() once chaotic_counting() is done with its execution.\n","\n","Here's a sample run of this program:\n","\n","I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first. 1 2 3 I'm done."],"metadata":{"id":"L-ZJ-W37-AQm"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","\n","DONE_LIKELIHOOD = 0.3\n","\n","def chaotic_counting():\n","    for i in range(10):\n","        curr_num = i + 1\n","        if done():\n","            return # this ends the function execution, so we'll get back to the main() function!\n","        print(curr_num)\n","\n","# There is no need to edit code beyond this point\n","\n","def done():\n","    \"\"\" Returns True with a probability of DONE_LIKELIHOOD \"\"\"\n","    if random.random() < DONE_LIKELIHOOD:\n","        return True\n","    return False\n","\n","def main():\n","    print(\"I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first.\")\n","    chaotic_counting()\n","    print(\"I'm done\")\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    main()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nmPu4QFP-k3f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744227474292,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Areesha khan","userId":"16032718573199384348"}},"outputId":"006b78dc-fd9f-489a-b97e-0450c5baf588"},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first.\n","1\n","2\n","3\n","4\n","5\n","6\n","7\n","8\n","9\n","10\n","I'm done\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
